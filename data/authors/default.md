Hello! I'm **Hang DONG**, software engineer based in Paris,France.

Here I write down all my thoughts on learning coding.
Since I decided to update whenever I got some new thoughts(or blabla),
it may not always be the final, well-structured and neat article.
Often, my thoughts are largely divergent and I let them go wherever they want.
I just write down every path they go and see it, not trying to get a conclusion.
Also, I choose to write in an extremely simple way and update once a week.
So let's just have some fun.

04/2024 - This month I'm focused on Java and Spring Framework.
