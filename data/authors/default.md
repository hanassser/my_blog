Hello! I'm **Hang DONG**,

Here I write down all my thoughts on learning coding.
Since I decided to update whenever I got some new thoughts(or blabla),
it may not always be the final, well-structured and neat article.
Often, my thoughts are largely divergent and I let them go wherever they want.
I just try to write down every path they go and see it, not trying to get a conclusion.
Also, I choose to write in an extremely simple way.
So let's just have some fun.
