## What is Data Structures and Algorithms
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data. Algorithms are ways of manipulating and processing data. 
Often, algorithms are performed on specific data structures to be effective. In computation,
all we want is to use less time and less space to perform the same computation. So always think in terms of **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity**.


## Measurement of an Algorithm
In order to measure the performance of an algorithm, we use `Time Complexity` and `Space Complexity`. They are all expressed using big O notation.
- **Time Complexity** measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases.
- **Space Complexity** measures how much additional memory an algorithm uses as the size of the input increases.

- Linked List
- Set
- Map
- Tree
