## What is Design Pattern
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 
They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem.
A pattern is a more high-level description.  
(Dive Into Design Patterns, Alexander Shvets)


## Why it matters
- **Code Reusability**
  - it provides proven solutions to recurring design problems. don't need to reinvent the wheel. more efficient.
- **Scalability**
  - it provides structures and guidelines that can accommodate changes and growth in the system. Patterns such as the Factory Method or Abstract Factory allow for easy addition of new types of objects without modifying existing code.
- **Maintainability**
  - it's easier to understand and maintain.
- **Standardization**
  - it provides a common language and set of concepts that developers can use to communicate and collaborate effectively.
- **Quality Assurance**
  - it promotes best practices and architectural principles that lead to higher-quality software.


## Classification of patterns (by their intent)
- **Creational patterns**
  provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    - Factory Method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype
    - Singleton
- **Structural patterns**
  explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy
- **Behavioral patterns**
  take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Observer
    - State
    - Strategy
    - Template Method
    - Visitor

## The five most used patterns
  
- **Singleton Pattern**
- **Factory Method Pattern**
- **Buidler Pattern**
- **Observer Pattern**
- **Decorator Pattern**
