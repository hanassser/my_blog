## Think About Language

[//]: # '![unDraw](/static/images/level_of_programming_language.webp)'

I got a striking feeling that I've been missing some crucial understanding.
Yes, here it comes. About programming language, think about it.  
It's a **language**, and language is used for communicating.
In order to use it, I have to know what this language provide, that is to say, know clearly about language's syntax and its API.
Otherwise, it would be hard to express myself or describe reality, like losing words.
Writing software is communicating with computer. I want the computer to solve problems for me.

So always remind, programming language is language. And what is the essence of language?

- **Abstraction** **Abstraction** **Abstraction**

And OOP approach is about mapping the elements in the problem space into the objects in the solution space.

Now I realized why I got stuck in coding sometimes.

- Not familiar with the syntax and API, so I can't find the right word to say it.
- Not familiar with the best practice, so I don't know how to optimize code.

To solve this, I decided to really dive into the documentation of JDK 17 and Spring.
