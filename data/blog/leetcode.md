## Types of LeetCode Questions
- **Math**
- **Arrays and Strings**
  - Basic Operations (e.g., Two Sum, Reverse String)
  - Subarray/Substring Problems (e.g., Maximum Subarray, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)
- **Linked Lists**
  - Basic Operations (e.g., Add Two Numbers, Merge Two Sorted Lists)
  - Advanced Problems (e.g., Reverse Linked List, Remove Nth Node From End of List)
- **Trees**
  - Traversal Problems (e.g., Preorder Traversal, Inorder Traversal)
  - Binary Search Trees (e.g., Validate Binary Search Tree, Lowest Common Ancestor)
- **Dynamic Programming**
  - Climbing stairs
  - Knapsack Problems (e.g., 0/1 Knapsack, Coin Change)
  - Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance
- **Sorting and Searching**
  - Basic Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
  - Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- **Graphs**
  - Traversal Problems (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
  - Shortest Path Problems (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm)
- **Backtracking**
  - Subset Problems (e.g., Subsets, Combination Sum)
  - Permutation Problems (e.g., Permutations, N-Queens)
- **Bit Manipulation**
  - Basic Operations (e.g., Bitwise AND, Bitwise XOR)
  - Counting Set Bits, Gray Code
  

## Approaches and Solutions
- **Brutal Force Approach**
- **Optimized Approaches**
  - Two-Pointer Technique
  - Sliding Window Technique
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Greedy Approach
  - Backtracking
  - Recursion
- **Common Data Structures**  
  Utilize appropriate data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables based on problem requirements.

## Tips for LeetCode preparation
- Recognize common problem-solving patterns and apply them appropriately.
- Reading others' solutions to gain some insights.
- Mock interview. Simulate real interview scenarios and improve problem-solving under pressure.
