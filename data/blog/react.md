I often ask myself, what's the difference between those developers with different years of experience? 
If I know clear about it, it gonna be much easier to improve accordingly.
Learning is a process when you don't get what you want. So first, determine what you want?
Taking React for example, as we all know that first year, we should know clear about the syntax and common practices.
The [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn) should be carved in mind.
