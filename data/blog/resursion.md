summary: "Recursion in programming refers to the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It's a powerful concept to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems."

## In order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion ðŸ« 
## `Break one big problem into smaller, similar sub-problems`
Ironically, I learn about Recursion recursively... (first time I realize this) ðŸ« 
No matter how many times (4 times) I learned about recursion, I still get intimidated when I see one recursion problem, so I have to go back and learn it again.
What's wrong? I think the reason is both a lack of practice and a deep understanding.
This time I decided to dig deeper and merge this concept thoroughly in my mind.
Before everything, I want to share a [well-explained video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCos392W4w&ab_channel=Reducible) about recursion.

## History
The concept of recursion has been present in mathematics (in ancient times) and computer science for many centuries. 
The most known ones are `Euclidean Algorithm`, `Fibonacci Sequences`, `Pacal's Triangle`, `Edsger Dijkstra` chronological.
Now, recursion is commonly used to solve problems like `tree traversal`, `searching`, `sorting`, and `mathematical calculations`.
And we also use recursive algorithms solve great amount of LeetCode questions, including `Arrays and Strings`, `Linked Lists`, `Trees and Graphs`, `Recursion`, `Dynamic Programming`,
`Binary Search`, `Backtracking` and so on.
So if you don't know about Recursion well, the interview is done.

## Known Recursion
- `Euclidean Algorithm`


- `Fibonacci Sequences`

  ```Java
  public class Fibonacci {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; //  n: Fibonacci number index
        int result = fibonacci(n);
        System.out.println("The " + n + "th Fibonacci number is: " + result);
    }

    // Recursive method to calculate the nth Fibonacci number
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        } else {
            return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
        }
    }
  }
  ```
- `Pacal's Triangle`

- `Edsger Dijkstra`  
    Dude is a great Dutch computer scientist, check out his paper on [Recursive Programming](https://ics.uci.edu/~jajones/INF102-S18/readings/07_dijkstra.pdf).
    Dijkstra's algorithm shows us the shortest path from one node to every other node.
    ```Java
    import java.util.*;

    public class DijkstraAlgorithm {

      static class Edge {
        int to, weight;

        public Edge(int to, int weight) {
            this.to = to;
            this.weight = weight;
        }
      }

      public static void dijkstra(List<List<Edge>> graph, int source) {
        int n = graph.size();
        int[] dist = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dist[source] = 0;

        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        pq.offer(new int[]{source, 0});

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = pq.poll();
            int u = curr[0], distance = curr[1];

            if (distance > dist[u]) continue; // Skip if outdated distance

            for (Edge edge : graph.get(u)) {
                int v = edge.to, weight = edge.weight;
                if (dist[u] + weight < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
                    pq.offer(new int[]{v, dist[v]});
                }
            }
        }

        // Print the shortest distances from source to all nodes
        System.out.println("Shortest distances from source " + source + ":");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.println("Node " + i + ": " + dist[i]);
        }
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5; // Number of nodes
        List<List<Edge>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        // Add edges to the graph
        graph.get(0).add(new Edge(1, 4));
        graph.get(0).add(new Edge(2, 2));
        graph.get(1).add(new Edge(2, 5));
        graph.get(1).add(new Edge(3, 10));
        graph.get(2).add(new Edge(3, 3));
        graph.get(3).add(new Edge(4, 7));

        int source = 0; // Source node
        dijkstra(graph, source);
      }
    }

    ```
  


## General Approach
1. Identify edge case:
2. Break down the problem:
3. Recursive call: 
4. Combine results:
5. Handle base cases:
