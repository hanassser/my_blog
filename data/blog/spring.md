## Spring Framework
[All versions of Spring Framework documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/)  

I started with [4.0.x](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/index.html) coz I find its layout well-structured and easy to get on. 
Also, I've chosen [5.3.x](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.x/reference/html/index.html) and the current version [6.1.5](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/)
to gain some comparison perspectives. 


## My approach
This time, I remind myself, always treat the documentation as a tree structure. 
Each tree node is a concept, and each concept branch out into several sub-concepts.
No concept stands alone. **In nature, everything is connected.**  
So first, get the upper most tree nodes (the most abstract ones). Then, branch out the sub-concepts.

|| Before drawing this tree of concepts in my mind, get the 10 keywords of Spring Framework to get a first impression.  
**Dependency Injection, Aspect-Oriented Programming(AOP), Inversion of Control(IOC), Model-View-Controller(MVC), 
Application Context, Bean, Bean Container, Spring Core, Transaction Management, Spring Data JPA**  
I shall explain all these concepts later in my words.


## What is Spring
The Spring Framework is divided into modules (**Spring is modular**). Applications can choose which modules they need. 
At the heart are the modules of the core container, including a configuration model and a dependency injection mechanism. 
Beyond that, the Spring Framework provides foundational support for different application architectures, 
including messaging, transactional data and persistence, and web. It also includes the Servlet-based Spring MVC web framework and, 
in parallel, the Spring WebFlux reactive web framework.

Foremost is the Spring Frameworkâ€™s Inversion of Control (IoC) container. Then its own AOP framework.
