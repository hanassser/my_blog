## [Spring Framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/4.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/index.html)
## Practice

I realized coding is **a matter of proficiency**, and proficiency demands for repetitively practice.
So now, when I read each chapter, I write the code and exercises inside. 
Only think in mind is not enough, it's like doing sports. I have to use my fingers to write code a lot to get that fluency.
So don't be lazy. Just write the code.

## Notes
Take notes and use drawings. Drawings are much easy to understand and remember. When I close my eyes and think about a concept, it's better in image.
