## Meta-Thinking
Attention! Attention!! Attention!!!
If I think the same way, I won't get different result. 
Action traces back to think.
So it's crucial to know Meta-Thinking.
Meta-Thinking is Thinking about Thinking, or being aware of one's own thought processes.
It involves reflecting on 
- how we think?
- how we analyze problems?
- how we make decisions?
- how we approach tasks?  
  
I should be more conscious of my cognitive habits, biases, strengths and weaknesses.
Then I can improve critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills.
(first see. see it. see the pattern. then I can change it.)
