## Meta-Thinking
Attention! Attention!! Attention!!!
If I think the same way, I won't get different result.
So it's crucial to know Meta-Thinking.
Meta-Thinking is Thinking about Thinking, or being aware of one's own thought processes.
It involves reflecting on 
- how we think?
- how we analyze problems?
- how we make decisions?
- how we approach tasks?  
  
I should be more conscious of my cognitive habits, biases, strengths and weaknesses.
Then I can improve critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills.
(first see. see it. see the pattern. then I can change it.)



## Practice

I realized coding is **a matter of proficiency**, and proficiency demands for repetitively practice.
So now, when I read each chapter, I write the code and exercises inside. 
Only think in mind is not enough, it's like doing sports. I have to use my fingers to write code a lot to get that fluency.
So don't be lazy. Just write the code.

## Notes
Take notes and use drawings. Drawings are much easy to understand and remember. When I close my eyes and think about a concept, it's better in image.
