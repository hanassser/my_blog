## Meta-Thinking
Attention! Attention!! Attention!!!  
If I think the same way, I do the same way, and I won't get different result. 
Action traces back to think. Normally people just think, consciously, subconsciously or without conscious.
And we don't know how we think, the structure of think, the way we think. 
That's crucial. And it's called Meta-Thinking.
Meta-Thinking is **Thinking about Thinking**, or being aware of one's own thought processes.
It involves reflecting on 
- how we think?
- how we analyze problems?
- how we make decisions?
- how we approach tasks?  
  
I should be more conscious of my cognitive habits, biases, strengths and weaknesses.
Then I can improve critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills.
(first see. see it. see the pattern. then I can change it.)



## Self analyse
How and why do I get into some common misunderstandings?
